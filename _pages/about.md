Shuojun Li received his B.S. degree in Chemistry from Huazhong Agricultural University in 2017 and his Ph.D. in Chemical Biology in 2023. He then joined the Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, as a postdoctoral researcher. In 2025, he was appointed as an Assistant Professor at the School of Life Sciences, Fudan University. His research focuses on bridging chemistry and biology to pioneer new research fields. He has published multiple papers in journals such as Nature and Angewandte, with his work highlighted by Nature Chemical Biology, Cancer Discovery, and other international media outlets.


## 🔬 Research


Dr. Li’s research lies at the interface of chemical biology and nanomedicine, with a focus on the design of intelligent nanoplatforms that can be precisely regulated by external physical or chemical signals. His group aims to develop chemical tools to dissect and manipulate complex biological systems. The main directions include (1) Cell-surface engineering and innovative immunotherapy. (2) Development of novel molecular labeling tools. (3) Multi-scale nano delivery platforms and functional regulation.

We welcome motivated postdoctoral researchers and graduate students to join our team.
